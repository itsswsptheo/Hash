1.	What is it?

The Student Grade Management System is a simple Java console application that allows you to store, retrieve, and remove student grades using a Hashing. It associates each student's name with their grade and provides a menu for managing this data.



2.	What can it do?

Add a student's grade: Store a student's name and their corresponding grade. Display a student's grade: Retrieve and show the grade of a specific student by their name. Remove a student's grade: Delete a student's grade from the system. Exit the program: Close the application.

3.	Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community?

I created the Student Grade Management System to practice using Hashing and show how they can efficiently store and manage data, like student names and their grades. It’s a simple example of how to handle key-value pairs, making it easy to add, retrieve, or remove student data.

For me, it’s a way to improve my skills with Hashing. For others, it’s a great starting point to learn about data management and can be expanded for more complex systems, like tracking additional student info or building educational tools.
